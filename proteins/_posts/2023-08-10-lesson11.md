The idea for this lesson is to give you a taste of what else is out there. We have covered a lot of ground in this course, but there is still so much more to learn. Here are a few topics that you might find interesting and look at during this week's exercise:

## 1. Visualization for structural biology


## 2. New advances in de novo protein design


## 3. Sequence bioinformatics


## 4. Omics data analysis
