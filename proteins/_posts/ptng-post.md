# ML for Protein Engineering - Where are we heading?

In my role as consultant for machine learning and computational biology projects, I recently authored a [blog post](https://www.ptngconsulting.com/blog/machine-learning-for-protein-engineering-here-to-stay) for PTNG Consulting in which I summarize where the field of ML for proteins currently stands and what of the chances and challenges that lie ahead might be. 

Here, I want to elaborate a bit on that by specifically talking about generative models, something I have been involved in both as a researcher and as an author of a book chapter about the topic (more details to come soon!). I hope that this gives you an idea of the kind of algorithms that people use when they think about generating novel proteins and demystifies some of the recent news articles about "magic" or "sentient" ML models generating novel content such as text or images.

## Closing thoughts

I recently had a conversation about this topic which brought up an interesting point: people often (rightfully) critize the hype that is associated with ML for biology and bioinformatics. But there is another point to this debate that is often overlooked: despite all the downsides to the hype, it also brought some underappreciated benefits. One that I came to value quite a lot in my work at EMBL-EBI in the last months is the advent of best practices from software engineering to biological programs.

Anyone who ever worked in bioinformatics will sing you a song of the lack
