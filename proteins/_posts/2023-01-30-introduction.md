## This course

List of modules: 

1. Introduction to PyMol and the GUI
2. Protein Structure and function
3. Protein folding and stability
4. Enzyme catalysis
5. Nucleic Acids
6. Carbohydrates and Lipids
7. Membranes - Pumps and Channels

Along the way, we will be learn to use the following tools:

1. PyMol GUI
2. PyMol scripting
3. Python scripting
4. PDB
5. UniProt
6. Blender (for fancy graphics)

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course. However, you will need to have a computer with PyMol installed. 

In addition, a mouse is required to use PyMol. If you are using a laptop, you will need to connect an external mouse. Trust me, using PyMol with a trackpad is just not fun. 

You can also download the [PyMol cheatsheet](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/CheatSheet). It seems like a lot of information, but you will be surprised how quickly you will be able to find what you are looking for once you went through the course.

There are two different versions of PyMol: the free version and the commercial version developed by Schrödinger.

### Installation of free version

The instructions for downloading the open-source version differ depending on your operating system. Here I linked the instructions for [Windows](), [Mac](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/MAC_Install), and [Linux](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Linux_Install) from the [PyMol Wiki](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Windows_Install) (in general a good place to start looking for stuff regarding PyMol if you are stuck).

### Installation of commercial version

The commercial version of PyMol is developed by Schrödinger. It is a very powerful tool with a lot of other functionality, but it is not free. However, you can get a free license for students and teachers via the [PyMol website](https://pymol.org/edu/). After obtaining your educational license you can download the correct version for your operating system from the [PyMol website](https://pymol.org/2/) and follow the [installation instructions](https://pymol.org/2/support.html?#installation).
