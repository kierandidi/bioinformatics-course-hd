Hey everyone! This is a course about PyMol and how to use it to visualize and analyze protein structures. It is taught in the biochemistry undergraduate course at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), but the material is open to be used by everyone. By the end of this course, you will be able to use PyMol to visualize and analyze protein structures. You will also be able to use PyMol to create publication-quality figures. 

This course heavily builds on the material provided by Kjaergaard et al. in their [publication](https://meridian.allenpress.com/the-biophysicist/article/3/2/106/489572/A-Semester-Long-Learning-Path-Teaching), on the [PyMol Wiki](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page) and YouTube channels, most prominently the tutorials by [PyMOL Ross](https://www.youtube.com/@pymolross) and [Molecular Memory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMhYZpMLtal_Z7to3by2ATHP-cI4ma5X). 

In addition, for the part using Blender we use many of the examples and resources provided by the two awesome YouTube channels [Brady Johnston](https://www.youtube.com/@BradyJohnston) and [LuminousLab](https://www.youtube.com/@LuminousLab).

This course is designed to be taken in a semester-long format, but can be completed in a shorter time frame. The course is divided into 10 modules with accompanying videos and exercises. The modules are:

1. Introduction to PyMol and the GUI
2. Protein Structure and function
3. Protein folding and stability
4. Enzyme catalysis
5. Nucleic Acids
6. Carbohydrates and Lipids
7. Membranes - Pumps and Channels
8. Evolution and Bioinformatics
9. Protein Design
10. Animations and Publication Quality Graphics

I hope you enjoy the course! In case you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me via Mail or Twitter (see buttons on start page).
