## Basic destructuring (List/Array)


## Closing thoughts

I cannot help but feel like with the recent ES updates developers from other languages (such as Python) should be convinced to use JS due to the lower barrier of entry. While the rest operator is from my point of view a good result of this effort, there are others that are way more controversial, such as the addition of the [class syntax](https://everyday.codes/javascript/please-stop-using-classes-in-javascript/). Maybe I will cover this one in a future post.
Anyway, I hope that this post helped to clear up some confusion around the different destructuring options in Python and JS!
