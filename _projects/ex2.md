# Exercise 2 - Machine Learning in Biochemistry

In the lecture we talked about the basics of machine learning and how it can be applied to biochemistry. In this exercise you will be asked to review the ML concepts from the lecture and build your own small models.

## Exercise 2.1 - Build your own model from scratch

In [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16wAHw82nqgDexl2-NbGHjcVqgg74Vjmd?usp=sharing), you are asked to build a model in pure Python to get an idea of what happens under the hood of a neural network.

## Exercise 2.2 - Build a model with PyTorch

In [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1myi3gtkRBla3XbVXHlJByDu7tv46cp1H?usp=sharing), you are asked to build a model in PyTorch to get an idea of how to use a framework to build a neural network. These frameworks are great to simplify your work, but should not be used as blackboxes!
