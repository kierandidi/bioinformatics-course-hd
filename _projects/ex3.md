# Exercise 3 - Protein structure and function, protein structure prediction

## CATH

There are several different classifications of observed protein structures:
- [CATH](http://www.cathdb.info/)
- [SCOP](http://scop2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)
- [DALI](http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/start)

In this assignment we will use CATH, which classifies domains into four levels: Folding Class, Architecture, Topology and Homology.
Go to the CATH website and select "Browse" in the top line.
