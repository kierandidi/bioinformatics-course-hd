# Exercise 7 - Generative Modelling

To learn a bit more about the theory of generative modelling, read through Chapter 17 (VAEs) and Chapter 18 (Diffusion Models) of the book [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/). You do not need to grasp all the details, but try to understand the main ideas and the differences between the approaches.

After this, work through the following notebooks:

1. [Writing a Diffusion Encoder](https://colab.research.google.com/github/udlbook/udlbook/blob/main/Notebooks/Chap18/18_1_Diffusion_Encoder.ipynb)
2. [Training a 1D Diffusion Model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/udlbook/udlbook/blob/main/Notebooks/Chap18/18_2_1D_Diffusion_Model.ipynb)
3. [Training a reparameterized 1D Diffusion Model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/udlbook/udlbook/blob/main/Notebooks/Chap18/18_3_Reparameterized_Model.ipynb). What is the main difference between the parametrization in this and the previous notebook?
4. [Train DDIM and accelerated models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/udlbook/udlbook/blob/main/Notebooks/Chap18/18_4_Families_of_Diffusion_Models.ipynb). What is the difference between the "classical" model from before and these two new ones?
